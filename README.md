Help You to Study/Review
This application is going to help you to master knowledge efficiently. You may confuse that why some people can get a good grade, why some people cant even they study very hard. This is because those people who get a good grade review their newly learned knowledge in a good way which is called 1,2,4,7,15 rule. Those numbers means you need to review your knowledge in those days, and once you do that, it is really hard to forget those knowledge. Therefore, this application will help you to record and remind you when will be the time to review. For example, lets say you just learned chapter 15 and chapter 16, then you just need type 15,16 and add it to the database,and it is all set. You just need to click todolist button to check if you have anything to do in the future, it will automatically help you to track your review processing.
Also, make sure you download XAMPP to run locally.
